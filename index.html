<div id="about">

<h1>Research interest</h1>

  <ul>
My current research interests are in multi-modal deep learning and computer vision, specifically in applying deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities (e.g., text, images and audio) and modeling the relationship among the different modalities. Some possible application areas include, for example, automatically creating poetry from images, generating high-fidelity, various images from text descriptions, and creating musical scores by inputting a story.

<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>
    

  <li> ProstateGAN: Mitigating Data Bias via GANs for Prostate Cancer Classification
    <br>
    Estimate the potential distribution of prostate imaging samples, and use conditional GAN techniques to augment the prostate imaging datasets based on the corresponding labels to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer classification.
  </li>
    
  <li> ClearGAN: Fine-Grained Text to High Resolution Image Generation 
    <br>
    Improve perceptual quality of generated image by considering both contextual loss and perceptual loss, and increase the resolution of synthesis by applying deconvolution network and sub-pixel convolution layer.
  </li>
    
  <li>
    Text Enhancement in Projected Imagery
    <br>
    Improve the visual quality of projected imagery by enhance text and non-text regions differently. Propose a text enhancement scheme based on a novel local dynamic range statistical thresholding
  </li>
    
  <li> Motion estimation for High Resolution Enhancement 
    <br>
    Deep learning: Improve spatial pyramid network (SPyNet) based on the idea of temporal convolutional network (TCN) for motion estimation of high resolution videos; Train TCN on image datasets to generate motion flow for videos
    Classical: Propose Kalman-filter based optical flow motion estimation methods to gain accurate flow fields for videos; Design directional blurring filters for anti-artifacts; Video scene cut detection
  </li>
    
  <li> Weight Quantization on Accuracy in Pre-Trained Mobilenets of Various Depth
    <br>
    Evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and model size using pre-trained Mobilenet networks of different hyperparameters for classifying traffic signs. Use quantized pre-trained Mobilenets (the last fully connected layer removed) to extract features and trained our own 32-bit and quantized classifiers. Cross compared the the changes in accuracy relative to the model size.

<h1>Personal</h1>
<ul>
  <li> I love travelling and foods. I've been to most places in China, the east coast and west coast in United States, and eastern Canada. Here are some <a href="erosie.html" target="_self">photography</a> I took during my travelling.</li>
    
  <li> I have a lasting passion for piano and have been playing piano since I was 5 years old. I had participataed a few of local piano concerts and had passed the piano 10th-level grading test in China. Besides, when I was in college, I joined the choir as a soprano. I would love to share with you a piano music I played: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgJIJ4YSb0/">千と千尋の神隠し Spirited Away</a></li>
    
  <li> I love playing badminton, table tennis, volleyball and swimming, and I have received special training, which brings me a strong body and more fun while playing. Besides, I enjoy outdoor sports and extreme sports. I often climb mountains in long weekends, drifting in summer, and skiing in winter. Since few years ago, I have been thinking to get a certificate of diving and a recreational pilot permit.</li>
    
  <li> I enjoy be involved in volunteer activities and I also devoted myself to the volunteer association as the president during my undergraduate study. Until now I still keep connecting with a school for the deaf and the dumb in Beijing.</li>
